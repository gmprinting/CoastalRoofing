            <h3>What is the CARE Maintenance Program?</h3>
            <p>CARE stands for Comprehensive Assessment &amp; Record Evaluation. It’s our free quarterly roof inspection program designed to help property owners stay ahead of roof issues, document their roof’s condition before and after storms and support future insurance claims or home resale.</p>

            <h3>How much does a CARE Inspection cost?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely nothing. CARE Inspections are completely free; there’s no catch and no obligation to purchase repairs. It’s part of our commitment to proactive service and community protection.</p>

            <h3>What’s included in a CARE Inspection?</h3>
            <p>Each inspection includes a full exterior roof evaluation, photo documentation, a written condition report and maintenance recommendations. Our technician will check for damage, wear and areas of concern—all without climbing inside your home or causing disruption.</p>

            <h3>How often do you come out?</h3>
            <p>We perform inspections every three months (quarterly) and also before/after major storms. You’ll be notified before each visit and provided a digital report afterwards.</p>

            <h3>What if my roof needs repairs?</h3>
            <p>If we find damage or areas of concern, we’ll provide a detailed repair estimate and walk you through your options. You’re never obligated to move forward with work, but if you do, CARE members receive priority scheduling.</p>

            <h3>Is the program only for homeowners?</h3>
            <p>Not at all! Our CARE Program is ideal for homeowners, commercial properties, real estate agents and property managers. Anyone responsible for a property’s upkeep can benefit from regular inspections and documentation.</p>
